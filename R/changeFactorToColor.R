## NOTE: Sorry, I just commented this out to stop git complaining about the lack of documentation and missing object Is.Neut... 
## (In case you are unfamiliar with this, highlighting all lines below and hitting CTRL+Shift+c will (add or) remove all #'s)

#   NeutCol <- factor(Is.Neut)
#   levels(factor(Is.Neut))
#   ### selected is first, neutral is second
#   levels(NeutCol) <- c("orange", "black")
#   ### orange is selected, black is neutral
#   NeutCol <- as.character(NeutCol)
